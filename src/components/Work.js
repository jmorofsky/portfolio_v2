                    <li>Collaborated directly alongside 12-person development team,

                    <li>Created a suite of automatic tests using Postman, which <span>provided

                    <li>Engaged in weekly bug hunts to actively <span>seek out existing

                        For this position, I worked on Airfind's client dashboard. This was a <span>web portal

                        revenue graphs, and contact us for support.

                        I <span>tested</span> new features being added to the web app, frontend usability,

                        multiple API endpoints to ensure functionality in all scenarios.

                        application. I ensured all components were performing their expected behavior, and
                        that their design was adequate both to perform their intended function as well as fit
                        in seamlessly with the rest of the application.
