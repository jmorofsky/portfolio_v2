My interactive portfolio. Here, you can learn more about me, my skillset, completed projects, work experience, and contact information. You can also download a copy of my resume.

The styling for my portfolio took inspiration from old CRT monitors. The interface itself is a mix between some modern and some retro elements. Overall, it creates an effect that looks and works great.

GitHub's API provides statistics about my profile, which are updated automatically every day.

Lastly, A basic form of BASH called JMSH lives inside the "OS" of the site, which itself is called jmL (short for jm-Linux).
